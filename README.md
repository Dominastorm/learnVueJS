Recreation of [Vue.js Course for Beginners [2021 Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpIoQ_rT_c) (0:00:00 - 2:26:20)

This repository contains my recreation of the first half of the video. It involved taking pre-existing static website consisting of HTML and CSS files and making them dynamic using VueJS. 

This implementation involves many static pages that do not store the state and lose information upon refreshing. Therefore, in the second half the website was built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Vue CLI. This implementaion is available in [this repository](https://github.com/Dominastorm/learnVueCLI).
